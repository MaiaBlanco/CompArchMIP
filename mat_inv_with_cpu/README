This directory and its files contained should be placed in gem5-aladdin/src/aladdin/integration-test/with-cpu/
Then, the accelerator can be built (with CPU simulation) by using the following commands:
make all-local
  This will perform the LLVM tracing step (which may take a while) and the gem5 make steps.
  The gem5 target calls the common gem5 Makefile to run gem5-cpu and gem5-accel, which build
  the standalone CPU version of the program (no accelerator) and the accelerated version.
  This results in two new executables.

Finally, the simulation can be run using ./run.sh, which calls the HW-accelerated gem5 exec.
